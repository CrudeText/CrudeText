# 👋 Hey, I'm William

I'm a curious engineer with a background in environmental systems and a strong interest in data, machine learning, and scientific tools. I enjoy working on projects that bring together tech, science, and creative problem-solving.

Most of my experience comes from working on water infrastructure projects, GIS mapping, and prototyping in the field — but I also spend a lot of time learning and building things on the side, from AI experiments to open datasets and electronics.

My python skills are self-taught, so don't be surprised if the script is not always optimized. As long as it works and doesn't take an hour to run, I'm happy!

This GitHub is a mix of personal projects, experiments, and learning journeys. Some are complete, some are half-broken — all of them are fun to build.
